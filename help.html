        <p>
            Written by Nicholas Sixbury for v0.1.0 of usda-alveograph-exporter in September 2024<br>
            For more/updated information, please see the relevant section in the user's guide.

        <h2>
            Basics
        </h2>
        <p>
            This program is created by Nicholas Sixbury and Dan Brabec at
            USDA-ARS Manhattan, KS for the use of Rhett Kaufman and his team
            to more easily extract data from the alveograph.
        </p>
        <p>
            As such, the program is designed to take a number of text files
            from the alveograph and compile them into a single output file
            which only contains the information desired by Rhett and his team.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default configuration is tuned to the current format of
            alveograph files and may or may not work if the manufacturers of
            the alveograph change their output format. For this reason, the
            configuration of the usda-alveograph-exporter can be edited to
            account for a number of changes. More information on configuration
            options is displayed later.
            <br><strong>
                You can reset your configuration to the default at any time by
                clicking the "Config Reset" Button.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                In order to use the program, assuming your configuration is correct:
                <ol>
                    <li>Click "<b>Select Input File(s)</b>" to select as many input files as you'd like.</li>
                    <li>Click "<b>Select Output File</b>" to select a location and name for the output file.</li>
                    <li>Click "<b>Process Data</b>", and the program will process all the files you've chosen.</li>
                </ol>
                If anything goes wrong during this process, you should receive an error message
                explaining what went wrong as well as your options for moving forward.
            </strong>
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            Configuration Options
        </h2>
        <p>
            In order to understand the options for configuring the program, it's
            probably best to start by explaining more of how the program works.<br>
            In each file, the program generally tries to find two things:
            <ul>
                <li>The test name for the data in that file</li>
                <li>A few rows of data showing the average results for that file.</li>
            </ul>
            Each configuration setting will be described below. If you would like an
            example of a working config and file, use the default config (obtainable 
            at any time by clicking "Config Reset") and the sample_input.txt file that
            should be present wherever your application is installed, in the same
            directory as the executable file and the help.html file.
        </p>
        <h4>Test Name Prefix</h4>
        <p>
            In order to find the test name, the program searches for a heading that goes
            in front of the name. For example, it might appear as "Test name : 23SC006" or
            something similar. We want to extract the "23SC006" from that line, so we set
            the "<b>Test Name Prefix</b>" to "Test name : ". The program looks for a line that
            starts with the prefix and then assumes that anything after the prefix is the
            test name. <br>
            You can easily set the test name prefix by copying the value out of your input
            file and pasting it in the box in the configuration settings labelled "<b>Test Name Prefix</b>".
        </p>
        <h4>
            Reading Data Rows: Finding the Start Header
        </h4>
        <p>
            In order to find the rows of data in the program, we need to find the line above where
            those rows start. This is referred to as the "<b>Read Start Header</b>", and there are two different
            ways of finding it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the "<b>Read Start Mode</b>" is set to "<b>Header</b>", then you can paste the header you're looking
            for into the box labelled "<b>Read Start Header</b>" in the configuration section. The program will
            then search each file for a line exactly matching the text you provide, and then look for rows
            of data underneath that header.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, if the "<b>Read Start Mode</b>" is set to "<b>Index</b>", then you can provide the line
            number of the row start header. Please note that <strong>the index for the start header uses
            0-based indexing</strong>, so if the line numbers in your file start with 1, subtract one
            from the line number displayed from the start header to find out what you should input into
            the box labelled "<b>Read Start Idx</b>".
        </p>
        <h4>
            Reading Data Rows: Selecting and Parsing the Data Rows
        </h4>
        <p>
            Once the program finds the Read Start Header, it needs to know which and how many rows to read.
            In addition, it needs a bit of information on how each row is formatted. In general, it is assumed
            that each row contains:
            <ul>
                <li>A header for the row, such as "P" or "L"</li>
                <li>A decimal value, which is the actual data for the row.</li>
                <li>A character or string separating the header from the value, such as a tab character.</li>
            </ul>
            It is also assumed that the header comes first, followed by the separation character, 
            followed by the actual value.<br> The separation character might also be repeated after 
            the value, in which case anything after the second separation character will be ignored.<br>
            You can specify the separation character by pasting the text from your file into the box
            labelled "<b>Row Split Character</b>".
        </p>
        <p>
            If the "<b>Read Row Mode</b>" is set to "<b>Header</b>", then in order to find the
            data rows, the program will match the rows it finds against the "<b>Read Row Headers</b>"
            setting. In the "<b>Read Row Headers</b>" box, several row headers are provided in a
            particular order. The program then looks for rows headers exactly matching the ones provided,
            in the same order. When the program either runs out of specified rows or encounters
            a line which doesn't start with the next header in the "<b>Read Row Headers</b>" list,
            it will stop reading data rows for that file. In the case of the program not being able
            to find all the headers its given, it might display an error message, giving the user
            the option of halting execution if this is unexpected.<br>
            You can configure the "<b>Read Row Headers</b>" by simply typing into the box labelled
            "<b>Read Row Headers</b>". Be careful to type each header exactly, in the same order
            they appear in your file. Do not include separation characters such as tabs or empty
            lines at the end of the box. The rows are labelled with linenumbers so you can see exactly
            how many lines are listed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, if the "<b>Read Row Mode</b>" is set to "<b>Max</b>", then you may
            simply tell the program to read an arbitrary number of lines after the Read Start Header.<br>
            For example: if you wanted to read 11 data rows that occur right after the start header,
            you could simply enter "11" into the "<b>Read Rows Max</b>" box. This is useful if the data
            rows might have different headers in different files, if the headers are not in the same
            order, or simply if you want a simpler way of configuring this setting.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Row Order Preference
        </h4>
        <p>
            There might be a case in which you prefer that your output be formatted with each header
            in a particular order. The "<b>Read Row Headers</b>" specifies how the rows are ordered within your
            file, but that order may not be under your control. Thus, you can use the "<b>Row Order Pref.</b>"
            box to change this. You can add Row Headers to the "<b>Row Order Pref.</b>" box using the same
            formatting as the "<b>Read Row Headers</b>" box, but Row Order Preference is much less picky.<br>
            Any rows with the headers provided will be placed at the front of the output, in the order listed.
            Any rows headers provided but not found will simply be ignore. Any rows headers found but not
            provided will be placed at the end of the output, in whichever order they appear.<br>
            Thus, "<b>Row Order Pref.</b>" will not add or remove any data from your output; it will only
            rearrange things.
        </p>
